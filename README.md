# ðŸ“ˆ Mathematics of Pricing Derivatives

This repository contains my personal project on **Mathematics of Pricing Derivatives**, where I explore the mathematical foundations and pricing techniques of financial derivatives such as forwards, futures, and options. The goal is to build a deep understanding of both the theory and practical implementation using Python.
