# Week 2: Portfolio, Forwards & Futures

This folder contains all Week 2 materials for “Mathematics of Derivative Pricing.” The primary focus is on:

1. **Portfolio Basics**  
   - Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) fundamentals  
   - Risk‐return optimization  
   - Sharpe ratio maximization  
2. **Forwards**  
   - Contract mechanics  
   - Pricing via no‐arbitrage  
3. **Futures**  
   - Exchange‐traded forwards  
   - Mark‐to‐market and margining  
   - Pricing relationships

Refer to the individual topic files (`.md`) for detailed notes and to the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for code implementations on a basket of tech stocks (AMZN, AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL).

<!--Once all concepts are covered, consolidate them into the **[Integrated Weekly Report](./04_Integrated_Notes.md)**.-->
