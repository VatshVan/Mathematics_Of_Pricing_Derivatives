# üìö Week 3 Integrated Notes

**Hedging with Futures & Options ‚Äì Summary and Self-Analysis**

---

## 1. Hedging with Futures

### üìÇ Overview

Futures contracts provide an effective way to hedge portfolio exposure against adverse price movements by locking in future prices through standardized exchange-traded contracts.

### üìä Key Concepts

* **Optimal Hedge Ratio:**

  $$
  h^* = \frac{\sigma_S}{\sigma_F} \rho_{SF}
  $$

* **Short Hedge:** Protects a long position from price drops.

* **Long Hedge:** Protects a short position from price rises.

* **Basis Risk:** Futures prices and spot prices may not always move perfectly together.

### üîç Practical Analysis

* Used **historical spot and futures data** to calculate the optimal hedge ratio.
* Simulated a **futures-based hedge** by sizing futures contracts proportional to exposure.
* Visualized **cumulative hedged P\&L** over time.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* Hedge effectiveness depends heavily on correlation and volatility.
* Futures hedging introduces basis risk but requires no upfront premium.
* Proper hedge sizing is critical to avoid under or over-hedging.

## 2. Options: Basics and Hedging

### üìÇ Overview

Options offer more **flexible risk management tools** compared to futures by providing asymmetric payoffs and limited downside exposure.

### üìä Key Strategies

* **Long Call Option:** Potential for unlimited gains with limited loss (premium paid).
* **Long Put Option:** Downside protection with limited cost (premium paid).
* **Protective Put:** Long asset + long put ‚Üí limits downside loss.
* **Covered Call:** Long asset + short call ‚Üí generates income but caps upside.

### üîç Practical Analysis

* Built **scenario-based payoff tables** for call and put options.
* Visualized option payoffs using combined diagrams.
* Simulated **protective put** and **covered call** strategies to observe their impact on portfolio risk.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* Options provide **downside protection and income generation** flexibility.
* Protective puts limit losses but involve premium costs.
* Covered calls offer limited upside in exchange for premium income.
* Options allow **customized risk profiles** not possible with futures.
