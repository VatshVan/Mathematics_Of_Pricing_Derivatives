# Topic 1: Financial Markets

## 1.1 Overview

Financial markets are platforms that facilitate the exchange of financial instruments. They are broadly categorized into:

- **Primary Markets**: Where new securities are issued for the first time (e.g., IPOs).
- **Secondary Markets**: Where previously issued securities are traded (e.g., stock exchanges).

## 1.2 Types of Markets

- **Capital Markets**: For long-term funding (equity, bonds).
- **Money Markets**: For short-term borrowing/lending (T-bills, commercial paper).
- **Derivatives Markets**: For trading contracts based on underlying assets.
- **Foreign Exchange Markets**: For currency trading.

## 1.3 Market Mechanisms

- **Price Discovery**: Determined by supply-demand dynamics.
- **Liquidity**: Ease of trading without price distortion.
- **Efficiency**: How quickly and accurately prices reflect information.

## 1.4 Relevance to Derivative Pricing

A deep understanding of market microstructure and segmentation is critical before engaging in derivative valuation. Instruments priced in derivative markets ultimately reference the underlying conditions of these primary structures.

> **Insight**: Derivative pricing models assume frictionless, efficient and arbitrage-free marketsâ€”assumptions born in the structure of these fundamental markets.
