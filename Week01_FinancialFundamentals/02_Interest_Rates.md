# Topic 2: Interest Rates

## 2.1 Conceptual Foundation

Interest rates represent the time value of money. They quantify the opportunity cost of capital and are used to discount future cash flows to the present.

## 2.2 Types of Interest Rates

- **Nominal**: Stated rate, not adjusted for inflation.
- **Real**: Adjusted for inflation (approx. Real ≈ Nominal − Inflation).
- **Effective Annual Rate (EAR)**: Reflects compounding frequency.

## 2.3 Compounding Mechanisms

| Type        | Formula                            |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Simple      | $$\( A = P(1 + rt) \)$$                |
| Compound    | $$\( A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt} \)$$  |
| Continuous  | $$\( A = Pe^{rt} \)$$                  |

## 2.4 Term Structure of Interest Rates

The term structure, often visualized via the **yield curve**, shows how interest rates change with time to maturity. It forms the basis for:

- Spot rates
- Forward rates
- Zero-coupon curve fitting

## 2.5 Applications in Derivative Pricing

- Discounting of option payoffs
- Valuing fixed-income derivatives
- Constructing risk-neutral probability measures

> **Insight**: Every modern pricing framework embeds interest rates—often as a stochastic or deterministic process—in its core model structure.
